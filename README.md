# RadioApp
An app that lets us to get a list of all the radio stations in Spain and the possibility to listen to the streaming of the selected station.
This app has been developed with Cubit as state management and build with some different animations.
The implementation of the streaming is fully decoupled by a layer inside the *plugins* folder inside lib to prevent the code to know anything about it.
